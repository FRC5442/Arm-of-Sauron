# Arm-of-Sauron

One robot to rule them all,  
One robot to find them,  
One robot to bring them all,  
And in build season bind them,  
In the land of WPILIB where programmers lie.

This project is for FRC Team 5442's 2019 robot. 
It uses an arm to place game pieces on the rocket and cargo ship. 
Honestly, we just hope it works.

"One word... Catapult!". -Literally every 5442 veteran who witnessed the 2016 and/or 2018 season.
